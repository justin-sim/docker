# Docker Guacamole

A Docker Container for [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/), a client-less remote desktop gateway. It supports standard protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH over HTML5.

Supported Linux OS: amd64, arm64, ppc64el

This container runs the guacamole web client, the guacd server and a postgres database (version 13).

## Usage (Multi-Arch)

```shell
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v </path/to/config>:/config \
  flcontainers/guacamole
```

## Parameters

The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side.

* `-p 8080:8080` - Binds the service to port 8080 on the Docker host, **required**
* `-v /config` - The config and database location, **required**
* `-v /etc/locatime` - Recommended to sync container time with host (Docker)
* `-e TZ` - Set Timezone (standard format: Europe/Berlin)
* `-e EXTENSIONS` - See below for details.

## Enabling Extensions

Extensions can be enabled using the `-e EXTENSIONS` variable. Multiple extensions can be enabled using a comma separated list without spaces.

For example:

```shell
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v </path/to/config>:/config \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  -e TZ="UTC" \
  -e EXTENSIONS="auth-ldap,auth-duo" \
  flcontainers/guacamole
```

**Extension List:**
- auth-duo
- auth-header
- auth-jdbc-mysql
- auth-jdbc-postgresql
- auth-jdbc-sqlserver
- auth-json
- auth-ldap
- auth-quickconnect
- auth-sso-openid
- auth-sso-saml
- auth-sso-cas
- auth-totp
- vault-ksm
- history-recording-storage

More information: [Guacamole release notes](https://guacamole.apache.org/releases/)

You should only enable the extensions you require, if an extensions is not configured correctly in the `guacamole.properties` file it may prevent the system from loading. See the [official documentation](https://guacamole.apache.org/doc/gug/) for more details.

## Default User

The default username is `guacadmin` with password `guacadmin`.

## Windows-based Docker Hosts

Mapped volumes behave differently when running Docker for Windows and you may encounter some issues with PostgreSQL file system permissions. To avoid these issues, and still retain your config between container upgrades and recreation, you can use the local volume driver, as shown in the `docker-compose.yml` example below. When using this setup be careful to gracefully stop the container or data may be lost.

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  guacamole:
    image: flcontainers/guacamole
    container_name: guacamole
    environment:
      TZ: 'UTC'
      EXTENSIONS: 'auth-totp,auth-ldap'
    volumes:
      - postgres:/config
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
volumes:
  postgres:
    driver: local
```
